  _description: Can target a dead suspect to search for clues. Investigating a victim
    reveals the identity of the suspect they most recently interacted with (visited
    or was visited by) apart from their killer. If none then turn up no traces. Investigating
    3 different victims of the same killer will reveal their identity with certainty,
    except for Overseer. Comes at the cost of reducing morale by 15. Passive chance
    of being chosen as a victim while using ability decreases proportionally to the
    number of dead suspects.
