  _description: Can target a suspect to kill them via ritual, if target is self will
    reveal role at dawn and kill no one. Will succeed as long as they are not interfered
    with (killed or roleblocked). Successfully killing a hostile suspect increases
    morale more than normal. If they kill a non-hostile suspect, they will take their
    own life by dawn.
